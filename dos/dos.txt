- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.
The insecure version allows user to give inputs that, when queried, causes an execption that crashes the server. By surrounding the code with try/catch, when an exception occurs the server remains up. 

- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?
Use a rate limiter to make sure users cannot spam the server with requests that slow/stop legitmiate requests.
